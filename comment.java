/*
1) Single-line comments -> start with two forward slashes (//).

Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:

*/
/*public class comment {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // This is a comment
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}
*/
//2)Multi-line Comment
//Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.

//Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by Java.

//This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:

public class comment {
	  public static void main(String[] args) {
	    /* The code below will print the words Hello World
	    to the screen, and it is amazing */
	    System.out.println("Hello World");
	  }
	}
